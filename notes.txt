ZUT freeze!
page will become a god component to solve the panel resizing/moving issues
maybe come back with redux in the future?



resizing and moving
  -- some draging issuew with clearing flags, also sizes to change
  -- real time updating db ? or save

 nested panels/comps
 -- not handling more than 1 level deep, maybe handle it at component level? maybe inheritance?
-- maybe component selector class instead?


to add edit mode
-- only then right click works, also resizing
-- on edit mode a tooltip is displayed on hover of panel to allow to set border and background
-- publish exits edit mode

tab persistance

FilterNoneIcon gone
multi right clicking should be possible


right click in panel must know it is in there
